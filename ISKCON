Dear Srila Prabhupada,

Please accept my humble and respectful obeisances. The first time I heard about Your Divine Grace was when I went to Mayapur ISKCON temple when I was a small kid. I don't have any particular memory about the temple there, but I still remember I felt very peaceful and filled with joy when I visited there. We stayed there just for a day. I also remember many Bhakts chanting the 'Hare Krishna Mahamantra'. We had tasty prasadam from the temple in our lunch.

Again, after so many years, I got this golden opportunity to know more about the worldwide 'Krishna Consciousness Movement' and got to stay in the FOLK Residency , while working in Hyderabad. It is only by Your Divine Grace that I am seeing so many positive changes occuring in my life.

I visited the ISKON temple in Hyderabad and sang and danced in the Kirtanas and felt an immense joy. Now, I am studying the books which were written and translated by You and can understand in full depth, the meaning of Krishna Consciousness. The book 'Bhagavad Gita As It Is' has provided so much motivations to proceed in my Life in a proper manner. Whenever I feel any confusion or depression or negative thoughts in my head, I study the Bhagavad Gita As It Is. The book 'Krishna' is also a source of immense knowledge about the pasttimes of Lord Krishna in this World. All these books have created a great impact on my understanding of religion.

I was immensely surprised when I came to know how You faced so many difficulties and obstacles while trying to share the knowledge of Krishna all over the world. But still, because of You , the name of Holy Lord has spread throughout the world and so many people are able to see the correct direction in their lives. I am truly indebted to the teaching You have given and promise to take it further.

Your Humble Servant,
Bhakta Rudranil Gupta
